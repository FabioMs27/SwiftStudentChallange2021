# Firekeeper (Swift Student Challange 2021) - [Accepted]

My Swift Student Challange 2021 project. I was one of the participants who won the challange.


In this project I wanted to make you experience as best as possible (in 3 minutes) the situation I am going through at the moment. I am at an age of struggle, but one that everyone has to go through. I am a young adult. Young enough to be a begginner but not young enough to slack off and be fine with it. Yet most notably, I am fighting to stablish myself as an adult.


I sujest you play the game first before reading this part. In this project you listen to an old man telling you what to do and you have to collect flames so you can become a star and finally "stablish yourself". Here is the thing though. I bet you will struggled even though you heard the old guy, and that's because the game is suposed to be hard. I hope you got to see the end of it though. The thing about learning is that experiencing it for yourself is the best way to do it. In my age you constantly listen to elders, but at the end you have to do it yourself. You play as a fire commet to simbolise the flame and passion us young adults have. The flames you collect represent the opportunities available. There are plenty but you still have to do an effort to get them. By launching youself you loose energy, but most importantly, by staying on the floor you let youself be carried. Being carried means you are letting other people do it for you, and the consequence is that you loose your flame. By being carried you will never grow. By becoming a start that means you have stablished youself as an adult.
